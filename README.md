# 👋 Hi, I'm Karim Ben Jrad

I'm a **Software Data Engineer & Backend Developer** passionate about building **intelligent, data-driven, and scalable systems** that connect **machine learning**, **data engineering**, and **backend architecture**.

I specialize in designing and implementing **end-to-end solutions** — from **data ingestion and validation** to **API development**, **model deployment**, and **cloud automation**.

Currently, I work as a **Mid-Senior Software Data Engineer at Manaos (Paris, Remote)**, optimizing financial data workflows with **AWS**, **Apache Iceberg**, and **Athena**.  
Previously, at **Elyadata / Algobrain**, I engineered **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, developed **backend services** for AI models, and built **OCR and NLP pipelines** at scale.  
Earlier, as a **Data Scientist at Axefinance**, I developed deep learning models for **document structure recognition** and **financial data extraction**.

💡 I’m driven by solving complex data challenges and delivering **robust backend architectures** that make AI and analytics truly production-ready.
